        <h2>June 2023 - PRESENT</h2>

        <h3>Technical Lead | KPIT (Client: Mercedes-Benz AG) | Bengaluru, IN</h3>

        <p class=MsoNormal>In my current role, I am contributing to the development of Plexus, a scalable and efficient
            middleware platform, as part of its first release. I work closely with cross-country teams to deliver
            high-quality software using technologies such as C++, Python, Shell scripting, and Docker OCI containers. I
            am involved in all stages of the development lifecycle, including coding, pull request reviews, Git branch
            management, and continuous integration/deployment (CI/CD) processes using GitLab and AWS Cloud Developer
            Workspaces. I actively participate in Agile ceremonies such as sprint planning, daily stand-ups, backlog
            refinement, and sprint retrospectives, collaborating with product owners and stakeholders to ensure the
            timely delivery of features. Additionally, I manage development environments through Devcontainers, ensuring
            consistency across teams. By leveraging my expertise in cloud technologies, containerization, and Agile
            practices, I contribute to building a platform that empowers future application development with scalability
            and efficiency at its core.</p>

        <h2>JAN 2022 - JUNE 2023</h2>

        <h3>Senior Software Engineer | Hughes Communications | Gurugram, IN</h3>

        <p class=MsoNormal>In that project, I worked closely with cross-functional teams to deliver a
            high-performance, mission-critical Software Defined Radio (SDR) platform, based on the Software
            Communication Architecture (SCA 4.1). I collaborated directly with DRDO scientists at their Dehradun-based
            DEAL laboratory, contributing to the initial release of the product. Independently implemented three key
            modules for the SDR platform based on the SCA documentation. My technical expertise involved C++
            development on QNX, leveraging tools like Bazel and cross-compilation toolchains for efficient deployment.
            Additionally, I developed producer-consumer based applications, managed Git branches for feature
            development, and participated in daily face-to-face collaboration and integration sessions with the team,
            ensuring seamless progress and high-quality software delivery.</p>
